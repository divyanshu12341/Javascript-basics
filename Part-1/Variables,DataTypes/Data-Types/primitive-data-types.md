# Static Types vs Dynamic Types 

## Javascript:
It is a dynamically typed language.This means we do not need to explicitly define the types for our variables.Many other languages are statically-typed such as C,C++ and Java.

## Typescript
It is a superset of javascript which allows static typing.This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors.Here we can define data types explicitly.
